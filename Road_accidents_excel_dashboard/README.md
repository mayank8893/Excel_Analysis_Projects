# Road_accidents_excel_dashboard
The data for this project came from kaggle. The dataset had information about the road accidents, distinguishing between fatal, serious and minor. In addition the dataset contained information about the vehicle type, time of accident, the road type and conditions as well as whether the accidents happened in rural/urban area and if they happened during day or night.

The scope of the project was to clean and process the data and answer following questions:
1) Separate accidents by their seriousness.
2) Separate accidents by vehiche type, area.
3) Also, look for insights into light and road conditions and number of accidents.

The project started with some data cleaning where, missing values were dropped, then entries corresponding to "Fetal" were changed to "Fatal". The date was then separated into month and year. Also, entries corresponginf to different types of motocylces were clubbed as "bike". At this point the data was ready to be analyzed. Pivot table were then created to figure out total casualties and accidents by their nature. Additional pivolt tables were created to find out total accidents by "vehicle type". Finally, accidents dependence on light and road conditions was also analyzed using pivot tables. Once these pivot tables were in place, visualizations were created so as to convey the findings visullay.

The figure below shows the findings from the dataset.
