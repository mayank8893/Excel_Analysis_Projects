## Road Accidents Excel Dashboard

This project uses a publicly available dataset from **Kaggle** that contains detailed information on road accidents — including severity (fatal, serious, minor), vehicle types, time of accident, road conditions, and whether the accident occurred in a rural or urban area, during day or night.

The goal was to clean, process, and analyze this data to uncover meaningful patterns and trends using Excel.


### Key Questions Explored:

1. How are accidents distributed by severity (fatal, serious, minor)?
2. What types of vehicles are most commonly involved in accidents, and how does this vary by area (urban/rural)?
3. How do light and road conditions impact the number of accidents?


### Data Cleaning & Preparation:

- Dropped rows with missing values  
- Corrected data entry issues (`"Fetal"` → `"Fatal"`)  
- Split date into **month** and **year** columns  
- Grouped various types of motorcycles under a single `"Bike"` category  

Once cleaned, the dataset was ready for analysis.


### Analysis & Visualization:

- Created pivot tables to explore:
  - Total casualties and accidents by severity  
  - Accidents by vehicle type  
  - Distribution of accidents across different light and road conditions  

- Built charts in Excel to visually communicate key insights derived from the pivot tables

All analysis and visualizations were done using **Microsoft Excel**.

> ⚠️ The full Excel workbook was too large to upload to GitHub (55 MB), so only visuals are shared below.
