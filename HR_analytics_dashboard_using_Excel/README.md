# HR_analytics_dashboard_using_Excel

For this project I have looked at HR demo data with information on number of employees, their age, if they are still at the company, their education and their department. I have added **KPIs of total employees, total attrition, attrition rate, active employees and average age**. For the secondary indicators I have plotted **attrition by education, attrition by job, attrition by department and attrition by marital status**. Finally, I have provided **slicers on department and education field** to filter out the data as per the users needs. Please see HR_Data_Excel.xslx for the excel worksheet.
