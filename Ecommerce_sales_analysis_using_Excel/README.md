# Ecommerce_sales_analysis_using_Excel

For this project, I have looked at ecommerce sales analysis in USA using Excel. The data had information on month of sale, sale amount, profit amount, quantity, number of orders, category of sale and state of sale. I have created **key performace indicators (KPI)** in the form of total sales, profit, quantity, orders and profit margin. I have also **calculated year over year growth** of these KPIs. For secondary indicators, I have shown **sales and profit as a function of month**, noting that September, November and December are the best performing months. I have also **calculated profits by category** and found that technology items give the maximum profit. I have also **shown sales by state** and found that California, New York and Texas are three states with most sales. Finally I have provided a **slicer to filter out the dashboard** as per the users needs. Please see the Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis.xlsx for the **data, pivot tables and dashboard**.
