# Ecommerce Sales Analysis Using Excel

This project involves analyzing ecommerce sales data in the USA using Excel. The dataset includes information on the month of sale, sales amount, profit, quantity sold, number of orders, sales category, and state.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total profit, quantity sold, number of orders, and profit margin were created to provide a comprehensive overview of performance. Year-over-year growth was also calculated for these KPIs to track trends over time.

For secondary insights, sales and profit trends were analyzed by month, revealing that September, November, and December are the top-performing months. Profitability by category was examined, highlighting that technology products generate the highest profits. Additionally, sales by state were reviewed, with California, New York, and Texas identified as the leading states in sales volume.

A user-friendly slicer was included to allow interactive filtering of the dashboard according to user preferences. The accompanying Excel file, *Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis.xlsx*, contains the data, pivot tables, and dashboard.
